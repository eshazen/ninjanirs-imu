# Using the IMU with other systems

This page has some information for using the IMU with non- NinjaNIRS (fNIRS) systems.

The small IMU board comes in two versions.

V1:  ![](Images/v1-imu-front.jpg?raw=true)  ![](Images/v1-imu-back.jpg?raw=true)

V2:  ![](Images/v2-imu.jpg?raw=true)

Both can be used.  The V1 board requires either wires soldered
directly to the board or a separate adapter board which connects to an RJ-11 (modular) jack.
